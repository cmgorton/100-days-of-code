# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: Jan. 3rd, 2017 


**Today's Progress**: Began my FCC Random Quote Project.

**Thoughts:** I struggled with the Javascript at first but pushed through and figured out what was causing the errors. I still need to add a twitter button and link to an API.

### Day 2: Jan. 4th, 2017 


**Today's Progress**: Unable to add Twitter button.

**Thoughts:** Spent the hour trying to add a workable Tweet this button to my Random Quote Machine. I think I need to go back an relearn about the DOM and API's before I proceed. I will try to rework my Tribute page tomorrow.
